<div align="justify">The aforementioned goal is going to be achieved by the development of five subprojects: (1) software and hardware partitioning; (2) formal verification; (3) software and hardware synthesis; (4) prototype generation; and (5) implementation generation. A single and common example is going to be used by all subprojects.</div>
