<div align="justify">We propose a model transformation method based on TA patterns and mapping rules, and develop a real-time automatic transformation tool from RoboSim model to NTA model for UPPAAL. This work was successfully applied to the real case Alpha algorithm. The next steps are: 1. Automatic generation of properties for robots. 2. Propose a new DSML for modeling specific environment.</div>
