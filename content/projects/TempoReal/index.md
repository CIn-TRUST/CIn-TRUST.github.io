<div align="justify">This project aims to combine the use of formal methods and model-based testing in the context of real-time embedded systems.</div>

<br>

<div align="justify">The project considers the following research agenda: (1) investigate models for specifying heterogeneous systems, considering nondeterminism and time; (2) develop modelling patterns to embedded systems considering state- and process-based formalisms; (3) propose development patterns based on model refinement; (4) enable automatic code generation for both hardware and software; (5) develop a suitable formal testing theory that takes into account partial specifications; and (6) propose test selection strategies based on similarity functions.</div>
