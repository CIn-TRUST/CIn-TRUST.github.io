<div align="justify">It is one of the projects of <a href="https://ines.org.br/" target="_blank">INES</a> and is part of the <a href="https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/RoboStar/" target="_blank">RoboStar</a> initiative. The focus is on the design of a graphical simulation language, RoboSim, and mapping models in RoboSim to several target platforms: Arduino, B and Simulink/Stateflow, among others. Development of the final implementations from the simulations is also in scope. Finally, we will also consider probabilistic models, modelling of the environment and the development of real world applications.</div>
