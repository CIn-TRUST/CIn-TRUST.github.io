<div align="justify">Post-Doctoral Enterprise (by Home Office) at Lindy Labs, with focus on Formal Verification of Smart Contracts. Research productivity scholar (PQ), CNPq Call No. 09/2018 and productivity scholar in Technological Development (DT) between 2011 and 2018. He has a PhD in Computer Science from CIn-UFPE (2001). Also in 2001, he won the Best PhD Thesis Award from the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC). Currently, he is a Full Professor. His speciality is Formal Methods, focusing on: CSP, model checking, theorem proving, formal modelling and refinement. Currently he is also investing in Experimental Software Engineering, based on probabilistic tests and simulations. Current goal is to apply Formal Methods and Experimental Software Engineering to aid in the development of aeronautical systems, particularly in the understanding and application of Formal Methods in Control Systems as well as in the Safety Assessment process. From 2004 to 2008 he did research related to a collaboration between CIn-UFPE and Motorola. And since 2006 he has been collaborating with Embraer. He was vice-coordinator of the COMPASS (Comprehensive Modelling for Advanced Systems of Systems) project, Brazil side, funded by the European Community, FP7 programme during 2011 and 2014. He is currently coordinator of the research project CIn-Motorola whose focus is the testing of mobile phones.</div>
