Due to the lack of productivity and quality in software development nowadays, there is urging in applying manufacturing and software engineering techniques, in order to leverage the same benefits found in other engineering fields. This is the actual definition for Software Factories, on which there is a cost-effective assembly process and constant yearning for innovation. The developed systems will primarily have, in measurable and configurable ways, a high level of dependability. In special, INES\u0026#39; initiatives aim at radically diminishing project failure rate, rising satisfaction in product quality, with controlled cost and benefit. As such, the Institute will state and control the execution of activities with short-, mid- and long-term goals. It will also coordinate contributions from all institutions and research groups in this proposal. In general, researchers\u0026#39; areas within the Institute incorporate activities such as definition, creation, and deployment of effective software factories, with strong emphases not only in high productivity but also with measurable and controlled dependability. Specifically, researchers will work on a number of research themes connected to the desired goal: systematic reuse and software product lines; validation and verification of systems; techniques for software evolution and automatic refactoring model-driven development; domain-specific languages; software quality; experimental software engineering.

The cooperation proposed here is in the context of the ESPRIT Basic Research PROCOS II project (no.7071) on Provably Correct Systems. The emphasis is on a constructive approach to correctness, using proven algebraic transformations between adjacent phases of development: specifications, designs, programs, compilers and hardware. The purpose of this cooperation is to explore the development of embedded systems in such a way that the final implementation may include both software and hardware components. Rather than producing only machine code as the final implementation (as stated in the original objectives of PROCOS I), the aim is to design a partitioning algorithm which, based on some function of cost, determines what should be implemented in software and in hardware. The main concern is not the discovery of an original partitioning algorithm, but rather a correct design of (possibly an existing) one.","date":852076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":852076800,"objectID":"61259e72f393a406400e6b2ff5818b91","permalink":"https://CIn-TRUST.github.io/projects/correctsystems/","publishdate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/correctsystems/","section":"projects","summary":"This project is dedicated to cover the entire development process for critical embedded systems, from the original capture of requirements to the computers and special-purpose hardware on which the developed programs run.","tags":null,"title":"Provably Correct Systems | Concluded in 1997","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://CIn-TRUST.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://CIn-TRUST.github.io/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"https://CIn-TRUST.github.io/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"About","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"698ec02a1ddfb67196a1327f99506bea","permalink":"https://CIn-TRUST.github.io/collaborations/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/collaborations/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Collaborations","type":"widget_page"}]
